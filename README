# ipdt : Iterate Prisoner's dilemma tournament

ipdt (_Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament_) is a simple software
to organise iterative prisoner's dilemma competition between different
strategies.

It has been writen for the "[Mathematics and Biology Workgroup](http://www.gt-mathsbio.biologie.ens.fr/)" in the
École normale supérieure (Paris, France).

## How to 
### Just test it
To test it if you have python2.7 and pip installed you can just type:

```Shell
# Global install:
$ sudo pip install -U https://github.com/geeklhem/ipdt/zipball/master 
# Local install (do not need root privileges):
$ pip --user install  -U https://github.com/geeklhem/ipdt/zipball/master
# To uninstall 
$ sudo pip uninstall ipdt
``` 

Then you can run a tournament between all defnined strategies:
```Shell
$ ipdt tournament 
``` 

You can restrict the tournament to a subset of strategies:
```Shell
# list all avaiable strategies
$ ipdt list
# A tournament with only two strategies 
$ ipdt tournament --players naivecoop defector randomplayer
``` 

You can also run a single match between two strategies:
```Shell
$ ipdt match -p naivecoop randomplayer
```

If you want more detailed info on the output, you can use the options
(from the more to the less detailed output) `-v`: warnings (default),
`-vv` info or `-vvv` debug.
